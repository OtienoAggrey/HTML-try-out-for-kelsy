 we normally do alot of things for fun actually
 sleepovers, we normally lick ice, walk around the neighborhood together and much fun stuff.
 but the craziest thing we've ever done was this
 one day Terrie and i sneaked to school by making Resh jump over the fence
 Resh is a friend of my sister. Yes she is nearly 10 years old
 of course our plan failed. Sema kushikwa na soldier.
 we thought we were done for
 the security guard took us to the school headteacher, by the way it was during off school days, to our amazement the headteacher
 laughed.
 i wanted to laugh but you cannot trust Kenyan teachers a laugh might mean
 <em>"leta hio kiboko!"</em>
